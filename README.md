# APPOINTMENTS APP

## Task
Create a small, simple web app (TypeScript + React) to manage doctor’s appointments.

A UI should be built to support creating a new appointment and cancelling an existing one.

## Requirements 
* An appointment has a title, date, and time
* Design / structure (e.g. navbar/footer/sections) that looks nice & doesn’t break on different screens.
* The code is maintainable (clean code/architecture, tests)
* Document assumptions, decisions, and simplifications, so to make the context clear.
